# BallotBB 1.0 Readme

## About

BallotBB is the result of a set of conflicts on forum sites which resulted
in either anarchies or overstrict administration and abuse of power, often
alternating between both. BallotBB is a completely democratic forum software
based on a user's reputation rather than their assigned rank. Users gain
reputation for making constructive comments and lose it for making offensive
or nonconstructive ones. A certain amount of reputation is required in order
to make important decisions such as reporting posts for removal and requesting
patches.

## Requirements

* A webserver
* PHP 4.4.0 or later
* A database such as MySQL 4.1.2 or later, PostgreSQL 7.0 or later, or SQLite 2

## Recommendations

* Make use of a PHP accelerator such as APC or XCache
* Make sure PHP has the zlib module installed to allow BallotBB to gzip output
